# MARVIN

Open jupyter notebook

Run the first cell for the interactive 3D plot.
Adjust emission and incidence angles to visualize angles and vector positions.

Run the second cell to export the angle calculations to a csv file.

The range / increments are as follows and matches the goniometers motion in the experiments.
incidence_angles = np.arange(0, 46, 5)
emission_angles = np.arange(-50, 51, 2)
