Download the Jupyter notebook and run the first cell for the 
interactive plot which represents the goniometer's configuration.

You may have to install Anaconda or use an online application to run the Jupyter notebook.

The yellow plane represents the principal-plane.  The pink plane represents 
the near-principal-plane which displays the detector's path.

The blue vector represents the incidence probe.
The red vector represents the 'principal-plane assumed' detector probe.
The green vector represents the real detector probe in the 'near-principal-plane'.

Adjust emission and incidence angles to observe changes in computations live.
Hold right mouse button and drag to change viewing angle.

The second cell generates the associated csv file, which contains
computations of all azimuth, emission, and phase angles.
